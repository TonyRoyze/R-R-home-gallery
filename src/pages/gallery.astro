            Our Gallery built up on a special concept to display my antique
            collection. Constructions done using "Kabok" natural stones in such
            a way to maintain simple and natural atmosphere. Also considered to
            make an ancient building having space to display the gallery. Mostly
            the construction maintained a cooly cilmate to enjoy the Gallery
